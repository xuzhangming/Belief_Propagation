# Belief_Propagation
This is an implementation of the belief propagation algorithm, also known as the sum-product algorithm. The implementation is based off of the famous 2001 paper: Factor Graphs and the Sum-Product Algorithm. The paper is available from this link: http://www.comm.utoronto.ca/~frank/papers/KFL01.pdf, and details the algorithm that was implemented
